# COVID-19 RNN

## Overview
This repository contains code for a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model designed to predict COVID-19 cases. The model is trained on historical data and can forecast future case counts based on the provided input.

## Features
- Utilizes recurrent neural network architecture for time series forecasting.
- Takes into account various factors such as previous case counts, geographical data, and possibly external variables like government interventions or weather.
- Provides visualization tools for better understanding and analysis of the predictions.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Pandas
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the provided notebooks)

  ## Usage
1. Prepare your data: Ensure that your COVID-19 dataset is formatted correctly. The dataset should include relevant features such as date, location, confirmed cases, deaths, etc.
2. Preprocess the data: Use the provided preprocessing scripts or functions to clean and transform your dataset into a suitable format for the RNN model.
3. Train the model: Run the training script or notebook to train the RNN on your preprocessed data.
4. Evaluate the model: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics and visualizations.
5. Make predictions: Use the trained model to make predictions on new data or future time points.
